I took data from a verfied site(Kaggle) having multiple tables 

Out of all the business problems I chose Delivery perfomance Analysis , Marketing Analysis , Product Demand and Inventory Optimization

"I worked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for Blinkit, focusing on delivery performance, product demand, and marketing efficiency.

Situation & Task:

Blinkit, being a quick commerce platform, deals with high-volume orders and logistics. My goal was to analyze delivery times, product demand trends, and marketing performance to derive insights for operational improvements.
Action:

I cleaned and processed raw data using Pandas and SQL, visualized trends with Seaborn and Plotly, and categorized peak vs. non-peak hours to analyze delivery delays.
I identified slow-moving and fast-moving products, helping optimize inventory and reduce stockouts.
I also examined marketing campaign performance, analyzing revenue vs. spend using Power BI and Matplotlib to suggest budget reallocations.
Result:

The analysis provided actionable insights on improving delivery efficiency, optimizing product stocking, and maximizing marketing ROI. These findings could help enhance user experience and operational cost-effectiveness."
"I conducted an in-depth EDA for Blinkit, focusing on delivery performance, product demand, and marketing impact. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I analyzed delivery efficiency across peak vs. non-peak hours and identified slow-moving products for inventory optimization. Additionally, I evaluated marketing ROI, leading to insights that could improve operational efficiency and reduce costs."

What I could have done better 

I could have analyzed more deeply into the issues with the customer Feedback and sentiment analysis
I could have predicted the stocks using linear regresssion so that we are never out of stocks from our best selling products 
i could have used logistic regression to see weather which kind of customers are going to stop ordering from the blinkit platform
